## First Character(s) are used to identify what the following arguments will be used for 
## for example F=Field, P=Property, M=Method, PM=Private Method, etc... You get the picture.
##
## Second Character(s) are used to identify the object type you are dealing with.
## For example: s=string, b=bool, d=double, l=long, L=List(language specific), etc... Now its making sense!
##
## Last Character(s) usually a string are used to identify the variable,method name you are creating.
## Now lets add it all together in some examples down below:
## For example: 
##  - F s Name = private string Name;
##  - P b IsChecked = public bool IsChecked {get;set;}
##  - M v Calculate = public void Calculate(){}
##  - PM v PrivateCalc = private void Calculate(){}
##  You get the picture....
##
## Oh also N = Name of the class... hence why it only has the name property and no type assigned to it. This should be at the top always..
## it only makes sense..
## And E = End of class definition...this lets the scripts know they can stop. 
##
## The scripts only expect this type of layout, its pretty simple right now but feel free to enhance.

F s Name  # , s = string. ex: private string Name
